# HomologSearch
R package for identic model and nonmodel organism genes searching.

The package serves for searching similarities between two sequences (protein or nucleotide) in a fasta format. The evaluation is computed using the BLAST algorithm and output is a ta-ble of homologous locus tags and genes (if available). The HomologSearch is available in the GitHub repository under the name ‘JanaMus/HomologSearch’ and can be installed as a li-brary into the R language.
