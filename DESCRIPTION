Description: The package computes the similarity between two sequences in the fasta files. The similarity is based on the BLAST method. It uses rBLAST package to create a local databse from model organism sequence and subsequently to blast (find similar genes/proteins/sequences) non-model organism seqeunce to local database (model organism sequence). Finally the tool selects the most similar genes/proteins/sequences and save locus tags and genes (if available) into the output .csv file.
